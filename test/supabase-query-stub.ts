/**
 * A stand-in for a Supabase (PostgREST) query builder.
 *
 * Every filter method returns the same object, and the object is thenable, so
 * `await`ing it at any point in the chain resolves to `result`.
 *
 * Why this exists: mocks written as literal nestings —
 *
 *     from.mockReturnValue({ select: () => ({ not: () => result }) })
 *
 * encode the exact call chain a route used on the day the test was written.
 * Adding pagination or another filter to the route then breaks the test with
 * `.range is not a function`, even though nothing about the behaviour under
 * test changed. Several suites broke exactly that way when the digest and sync
 * routes gained `.order()` / `.range()`.
 *
 * Pass `result` as the resolved `{ data, error }` shape the route expects.
